# POMO6 Website 

## What is it? 
Pomo6 is a website created for my final project in the SoftUni course
on Django. The idea is to create a small site
similar to fiverr, where people can propose 
their help. 
The technology used is Python, and mostly
Django. 

## App structure 
The app is composed of several components: 
- pomo6: containing the home page 
- adverts: containing forms, views and methods 
for advert search, visualisation, modification ... 
- profiles: same as adverts, but for user profiles 

## Learning journey 
The goal of the project is just to get 
better at Django, and try to improve the 
app incrementally, following the SoftUni lesson.

If you have any comments on the structure
of the app, or beginner mistakes, feel free to comment.

Thank you!
